4,websec,Alternatives to CAPTCHA for Deterring Bots,"I've been toying with using browser fingerprinting to augment proof of work invisible challenges and wanted to share a quick demo I made:  [https://pow-browser-fingerprinting-demo.com/](https://pow-browser-fingerprinting-demo.com/).  The value proposition is simple: many websites today use CAPTCHA challenges (like those annoying questions asking you to select all the images that contain traffic lights) or use rate limiting as a shotgun approach to deter botting and prevent DDoS attacks on their websites. These approaches aren‚Äôt super effective and add a ton of friction to a user‚Äôs experience. Forbes published [an article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2019/08/07/your-captcha-could-be-hurting-your-sales/?sh=4e762c1b33c8) highlighting how expected dropoff can be anywhere between 8-29% with a negative impact on sales conversion of \~3.2-10.1% on average, and bots will often bypass endpoints CAPTCHA is displayed on. This is where real-time Proof of Work invisible challenges powered by Browser Fingerprinting come into play. These are challenges that are hidden from the user where the challenge difficulty varies based on the volatility of metadata based on the user‚Äôs browser fingerprint, so bots will experience significantly longer load times and will be discouraged from continuing their abuse due to using a ton of compute power to solve difficult challenges while real users will have a frictionless experience.

I also wrote a [longer form article on Medium](https://roshan-srin.medium.com/web3-security-proof-of-work-invisible-challenges-powered-by-browser-fingerprinting-a0238267e5f4) about this in case you are curious to learn more. Let me know if you have any feedback about my demo or the overall value prop. I'm still building and am continuously looking for feedback, hence this post. (Edit: I should add that the demo linked above doesn't work great on really old phones since the PoW challenges aren't dynamic yet for reducing difficulty on older devices.)

(Second edit: I will say that I've also seen rate limiting as a solution but that's not a great solution if multiple users share the same IP.)",1.0,5,0,5

6,websec,Tracking Modified Selenium ChromeDriver,"As always in security, attackers try all kinds of things to avoid being detected. We wrote a [blog post](https://datadome.co/bot-detection/tracking-modified-selenium-chromedriver/) about attackers that modify Selenium Chrome to avoid traditional bot detection techniques. 

Here‚Äôs how it works: 

Selenium is a technology that uses code to instrument browsers. It is popular among bot developers because it‚Äôs been around for nearly 2 decades and works on various browsers‚ÄîChrome, Firefox, Opera, and Safari

We tracked modified selenium using side effects engendered by their changes. This helps us understand the activity of bots doing a lot of scraping on e-commerce sites, some sneaker bots as well as fake influencers.

8,websec,Help: using a vulnerability,"Hi!

I have a site which I want to include as an iframe in another site. I found that this site's protections are the referrer header and a Google captcha v2.

To bypass this, I tried creating a proxy server that redirects the requests and modifies the referrer, this partially works - I do get access to the site, but at some point in the code flow it stops working, from what I've seen it looks like maybe the google captcha has its way to get my real referer and the site checks it.

Another thing I found is that if the referrer is localhost, it works, so when I put the site in an iframe in my site that was running on localhost, it worked - maybe this can be used somehow?

Any ideas?

If anyone is interested in seeing the actual site and researching it I would love to brainstorm on discord or just in a private chat here :)",0.6,1,0,1

I have previously hosted a website on my home network and configured an OpenVPN server to allow me access to my home network and that locally hosted website. So essentially that local webserver doesn't directly face the internet, but a client with the OpenVPN config can access that webserver.

Unfortunately I need to host some sensitive personal information on a VPS running Apache through Vultr and I was wondering if I were able to use the same approach to add some extra security to limit access to the VPS to clients with the VPN config. If I can, what would be the best way to approach to this?

This is quickly becoming something that is beyond my capabilities. Nevertheless, I'm pushing through and currently trying to understand the terminology being used in the section of the course that details common web service attacks. I've taken a step back to try and disambiguate some key terms, and this is how I'm trying to understand it (see table in image).

Is my understanding summarised in that table broadly correct?

This has taken me hours so I'm hoping it doesn't need a gigantic redo. Keep in mind I do not have a technical background. Sorry if my question comes across as stupid or basic.

This is all so that I can later disambiguate types of injection attacks, i.e., attacks on the web browser versus attacks on the web server and attacks on the database server, which I will save for a separate post so as not to complicate this particular question.

I am not sure how this is working [link](https://imgur.com/a/VeDjDSL). I am trying to learn union based sql injection. The screenshot 1 should display an error because data types are not compatible. However, it displays the row. 

According to port swigger, we can use payloads below to figure out which columns in original query return string data 

    ' UNION SELECT 'a',NULL,NULL,NULL--
    ' UNION SELECT NULL,'a',NULL,NULL--
    ' UNION SELECT NULL,NULL,'a',NULL--

So if original column is string, and attacker places 'a' in the same index of column in original query,  no error is there and row is displayed which lets the attacker know which columns are strings. However, if I add 1, which is an int in same index as the string column, it should give an error but the screenshot from w3 school says otherwise",0.81,3,0,3

35,websec,Does CSRF attacks really work?,"I'm studying about CSRF attacks for the first time. I have heard about Same Origin Policy. This might be a silly doubt but I'm not able to understand how CSRF attacks work. Maybe I'm missing something.

Say you're having an active session with the trusted site abc.com which recognises the clients only with the help of Session ID that's stored as cookies on the client's browser. 

Now you click a malicious link say xyz.com that tries to forge requests on your behalf to abc.com. This is CSRF attack. 

But my doubt is Why will the client's browser share the Cookies related to abc.com with xyz.com?

The SOP (Same Origin Policy) states that cookies and all sensitive data is shared among two sites only when:
- The domain is same
- The schema is same
- The port used is same

The first condition itself fails in the above case. So, how will the site xyz.com get the access to abc.com site's cookies?

I'm looking for participants with web development experience (+18, regardless of skill-level) for my research on attack-aware and self-defending web applications.

The main theme of my research project is in web security but the approach I'm investigating relies heavily on a developer's business logic expertise and intuition of knowing where in the application something wrong/malicious might happen. In order to identify how this expertise and intuition can be best utilized, I'm conducting and planning a series of research activities of which a questionnaire-based survey is my current one.

The survey's goal is to identify your experience with security controls and especially with input validation controls as these can be further utilized for detecting attack attempts. If this sounds interesting to you and you are keen to participate then please follow the link below to access the survey: [https://forms.gle/ex7n9ka6NWLWjPVW7](https://forms.gle/ex7n9ka6NWLWjPVW7)

Your support with your experience as professional web developers is highly appreciated, the results will enhance the research insights in this field and will be used to plan further activities with developers such as a prototype evaluation in a usability study.
